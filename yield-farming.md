# Yield Farming

Yield farming lets users that are providing liquidity earn KUS rewards by locking their LP tokens into a smart contract. The incentive is to balance out the risk of impermanent loss that comes along with locking in your liquidity.

KuSwap yield farming is designed to be sustainable, favouring long-term growth while still offering competitive APYs.
