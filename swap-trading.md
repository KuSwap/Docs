# Swap/Trading

KuSwap Exchange is a fully automated market maker \(AMM\) that enables users to trade two Kucoin Community Chain tokens. 

The exchange's liquidity is provided by Liquidity Providers \("LPs"\) who invest their tokens into Liquidity Pools. In exchange, a user receives LP tokens, which can then be staked in the "Farms" to earn KUS tokens. 

When a user conducts a token swap \(trade\) on the exchange, they will be charged a trading fee of 0.1 percent, which is calculated as follows: 0.05 percent is sent to liquidity providers as a fee, and 0.05 percent is utilized to burn KUS tokens.
